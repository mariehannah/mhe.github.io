With her plans of being a professional fencer foiled by a sudden financial crisis in the 1990s, a passionate young high-schooler wonders if it’s time to give up on her dreams. But the hardworking part-timer at the comic book shop may be the kindred soul she needs to keep her spirits up—especially when they meet again at ages 25 and 21.
